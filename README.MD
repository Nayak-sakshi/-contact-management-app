## Contact Management App

This Contact Management application utilizes a range of technologies to facilitate comprehensive contact management, CRUD operations, user authentication, and authorization:

1. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building scalable network applications.
2. **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications.
3. **Thunder Client**: An extension for Visual Studio Code used for testing and managing RESTful APIs.
4. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing contact information.
5. **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, aiding in defining schemas and models for contact data.
6. **REST APIs**: Utilized for communication between the frontend and backend, providing a standard way of accessing and manipulating contact data over HTTP.

### Functionality:

- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing contacts.
- **User Authentication**: Incorporating authentication mechanisms to verify and validate user identities before granting access to the application.
- **User Authorization**: Ensuring authenticated users have appropriate permissions to access and modify contacts based on predefined roles or privileges.

These technologies and functionalities collectively enable the app to efficiently manage contacts while maintaining secure access and control over user interactions through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
